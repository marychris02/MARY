            <p class="paragrahp">I was a shy person who avoided talking to people and kept myself to myself.
                 Even when I knew something, I wouldn't share it because I was afraid of being judged. 
                 I wasn't into many activities and avoided social situations. My personality leaned
                  towards being reserved and introspective. I found comfort in solitude and preferred to observe rather than participate.

                After such characteristics, however, everything shifted when I started attending the Pagarbohay event. 
                To me, that was a huge turning point out of my shell. I could now communicate freely with other
                 individuals and eventually increase my level of communication. Such an event triggered me to
                  tell my feelings as much as possible and air my views for no one could judge me; I found myself becoming bold and open.
                
                Participation in Pagarbohay helped me meet other people and build close relationships.
                 The engagement in different activities made me feel a newfound part of me, and experience the importance of going out of one's comfort zone.
                  Learn how to confront problems and understand challenges as part of growth opportunities.
                
                The event made me realize the value of teamwork. I learned to collaborate with others and contribute to a common goal. 
                My self-confidence grew, and I became more willing to take on new tasks and responsibilities. Overall, 
                the Pagarbohay event transformed me from a shy, reserved person into someone who is more confident,
                 communicative, and open to new experiences.</p>
