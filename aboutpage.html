My experience at Luxmundi's Cup has been truly unforgettable.
 This huge event at Tangub City Global College allowed me to showcase my talents 
 and learn from my peers. Participating in various activities not only helped me 
 build my skills in sportsmanship and communication, 
 but it also created lasting friendships. 
<br>
One of the highlights for me was being a part of Pagabohay, 
a unique performance during the event. In Pagabohay, we danced with lights,
 creating beautiful shapes and patterns that captivated the audience. 
 The choreography required teamwork and creativity, 
 and it was incredible to see how our movements came together to tell a story. 
            </br>
Dancing with light allowed me to express myself in a new way, 
and I loved seeing the impact our performance had on others. 
This experience taught me about the power of collaboration and the joy of sharing art with the community. 
Being involved in both Luxmundi's Cup and Pagabohay helped me grow as a person, 
making me more confident and open to new experiences. 
Overall, my time at Luxmundi was not just about showcasing talents, 
it was about personal growth and building a supportive community.
